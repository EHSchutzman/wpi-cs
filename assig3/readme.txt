Description of the programs:

	    mystring.c:
	    Contains the various functions that act on strings.

	    mystructs.c:
	    Contains the various functions that act on structs.

	    ctest.c
	    Contains the main function for demonstrating various
	    other functions.


Instuctions on compiling and linking the program:

	    Files included are ctest.c, mystring.c, 
	    mystructs.c, mystring.h, mystructs.h the makefile,
	    and this text file.

	    One needs to put these files in a directory, and 
	    then navigate to that directory from the command
	    line and give the command "make". 
	    (The standard libraries used are included by default.)

	    The makefile has the required instructions to compile 
	    and link all the programs.

	    The program can be run with the command './ctest'.

	    If one needs to remove all the files apart from 
	    the source files, the command "make clean" should be given.
	    
	    To generate the documentation using the Doxygen utility, 
	    the command "make docs" should be given.
