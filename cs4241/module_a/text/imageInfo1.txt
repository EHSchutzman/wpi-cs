I have always been interested in the historical significance of Stonehenge.
A Google search for Stonehenge turns up a phone number - +44 870 333 1181. I wonder who would pick up - I haven't tried it yet!
Stonehenge reminds me of a number of novels I have read - all of the novels below are connected in some manner.
