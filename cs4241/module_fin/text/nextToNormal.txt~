In this contemporary rock musical and winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, a suburban household copes with crisis and the unpredictability of a mother's worsening bipolar disorder. Next to Normal is a breath-taking ride that deals with issues very relevant to the lives of many, but don't be fooled, it has brilliant hilarious moments as well.

Performances are Thursday, Friday and Saturday January 16 - 18, at 7pm. Doors open at 6:30, and best of all it is FREE!
