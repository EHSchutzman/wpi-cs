This form is used to input data for the Broadway shows.

The dropdown menu contains all the shows that are currently in the system.

You can enter the week number (from 1 to 52, inclusive), and the revenue and count of seats sold for that week.

On clicking the submit button, the data for that week for the selected show will be written to the database.

Please note that if the data for that week previously exists, it will be overwritten!
