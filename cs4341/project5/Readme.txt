To run the code:

Download the bnt package to your home directory from here:
http://bnt.googlecode.com/files/FullBNT-1.0.7.zip

Unzip the package

Start MATLAB: 

Change to the directory of the unzipped BNT package and add all the subdirectories to your path:
>> cd ./bnt/
>> addpath(genpathKPM(pwd));

To run the project code, change directory to the directory that contains your code and then type the function names.
