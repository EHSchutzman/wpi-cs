This is our submission for the cs4341 class at WPI - project 3, Decision Trees.

We implemented a decision tree (without using Weka) that uses the training dataset of 80 
games of connect-4, learns from them using certain attributes, and generates the result 
of 20 test games to a csv file.

Included in our zip submission file are the following:
-this README.txt file

-bli_tnarayan_project3.jar, which is an executable jar file for our decision tree

-exe_info.txt, which contains information on how to use the executable jar file and the 
path and name of the resulting csv file

-decision_tree_info.txt, which contains a brief explanation about our decision tree 
algorithm, about how we calculate the importance of each attribute, and about how 
we prune the tree.

-Decision Tree Graph.docx, which contains an example graph of our decision tree

-attributeExplanations.txt, which describes all of our attributes in words

-test_dataset folder, which contains the training dataset and information about each 
training board state (same as what was provided in the assignment description)

-src folder, which contains all our code
