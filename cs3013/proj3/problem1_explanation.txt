Problem 1: Ninjas Vs. Pirates
Tushar Narayan: tnarayan
Cynthia Rogers: cerogers

This solution avoid deproving one side of the costume department because
whichever thread the turnstile deides to signal next will lock the costume
department ensuring that ninjas and pirates can both intermitantly use the
changing room one after the other as turn stile wishes (ie: this means pirates
can't pull other pirates that are waiting in, it's random whicheer turnstile
happens to choose).
