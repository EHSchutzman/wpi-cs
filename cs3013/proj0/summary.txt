Summary:
The goal of this project was to get the virtual machine working on my computer, to build 
the Linux kernel, and then install and boot into the Linux kernel. No modifications were made
to the kernel during this project.

Issues faced:
Since my host computer is a 2 core machine, the VMware Player was a slightly unresponsive at 
times. It also took a bit long to build the Linux kernel. Apart from these hardware related 
issues, I had no major issues during this project.
