1)Justify your choice of approach to handling cyclic cell references (in a sentence or two).
The visited list saves the cell references that are visited, and hence grows on every single function call. Hence, when the cyclic reference are hit,
the vistied list has that reference saved, and hence the function throws an exception. That exception is caught, and an appropriate message is printed.
(Since the program currently has no UI, the try-catch constructs have been placed in the examples class.)


2)Provide an argument that your ValueOf method will terminate in the face of a cyclic cell reference.
The visited list grows every time a new cell reference is encoutered. Because of the invariant of checking the visited list every time, the function processes
the cell referece iff the reference is a previously unencountered one, else it terminates. Hence, in the face of a cyclic cell reference,
the function to compute the value of a cell terminates.


3)Was there any advantage to our having used a visitor-organization for the ValueOf method on IFormulas?
It made it easier to process different types of data that can be in a cell. Also, it was easier to implement throwing the exceptions for cases where the cell 
is not found - only the cellRef traversal method could throw the Cell Not Found Exception (because of the visitor-organization).
