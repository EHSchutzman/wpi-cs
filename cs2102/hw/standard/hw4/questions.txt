Part 2) isMatch Implementation
The given implementation of isMatch is awful since it uses instanceof's, which goes against the purpose of using an OO language for dispatch. Java is supposed
to carry out type checks automatically - good OO programs should not check the type of objects explicitly, and the code violates this OO programming guideline.
Using instanceof also complicates the design goal of having programs that are easily extensible.


Part 3) Function Overloading error
The overloaded functions version does not compile since the function declaration in the IMatch interface takes in a MenuItem, whereas the overloaded
functions take in specific types of MenuItems (subclasses) and not the superclass. Hence a type error occurs, and Java tells us to implement
the inherited isMatch method that consumes a MenuItem.
