		<h3>Technology: Laser Weapons</h3>
		<p>
			The drones and Jack use laser weapons. There are plenty of laser devices used today, but technology hasn't hit the point where handheld laser rifles can be used. Laser guided weapons do exist. Though the laser isn't damaging a target, it is giving some sort of weapon (i.e., missile) guidance to its target.
