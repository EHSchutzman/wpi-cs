		<h3>Technology: Statis Modules</h3>
		<p>		
		The idea of a stasis module to temporarily suspend human life is a fictional concept for now. However, a field that could eventually develop into this type of technology is the study of cryopreservation. This involves using low temperature preservation to freeze humans or animals several minutes after death. A problem with this is that ice formed in cells during the process cause severe damage to the preserved specimen. Scientists believe that someday nano-technology will be developed to restore the damaged cells and unfreeze these specimens to restore them back to life. (see: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23695785"> http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23695785</a>).
