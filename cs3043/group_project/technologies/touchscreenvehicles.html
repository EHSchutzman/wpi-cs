		<h3>Technology: Vehicles directed by touchscreen</h3>
		<p>
			In the movie, Jack uses this technology to control his flight-capable vehicle. This technology is in the process of fast becoming a widespread reality. Touchscreen devices like tablets are becoming a staple inclusion in newer car models, and these tables are capable of running navigational services like Google Maps or Nokie HERE.
			<br /><br />
			Patents which relate to this technology are:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US6212473">http://www.google.com/patents/US6212473</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7640104">http://www.google.com/patents/US7640104</a></li>

			</ul>
			
			However, there have been questions about the safety of touchscreen usage in vehicles. The touchscreens can distract drivers (see: <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290410001669950#.U1VpQ_ldVtg">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01449290410001669950#.U1VpQ_ldVtg</a>). This will become a wider concern as the technology spreads, and also as touchscreen navigation devices are transforming into an in-car information and entertainment center. This may prevent the technology from becoming widely used.
