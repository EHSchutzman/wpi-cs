		<p>
			There is a tower viewer (coin operated binoculars) in the movie. The general consensus is that binoculars were first created by Hans Lippershey in 1608 <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342926/Hans-Lippershey">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342926/Hans-Lippershey</a>.
