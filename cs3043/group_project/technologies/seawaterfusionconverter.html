		<h3>Technology: Seawater to Fusion Energy Converter</h3>
		<p>
			The Tet uses the fusion energy converter to generate energy from the Earth for its own purposes. The fusion energy converter is a futuristic technology. Currently, we can harness the kinetic energy of seawater and convert it into energy that can be stored/used for electricity generation.

			Humanity has used water to power equipment for centuries - running water was harnessed to power mills in the early 11th century. Growth in technology has improved that process  - in 2000, the first large scale plant for generating energy from waves was built in Scotland.

			There have also been recent breakthroughs in nuclear fusion (see: <a href="http://rt.com/usa/fusion-energy-power-ignition-806/">http://rt.com/usa/fusion-energy-power-ignition-806/</a>), but large scale nuclear fusion power plants are still some years away according to the most optimistic estimates (see: <a href="http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond">http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond</a>).
