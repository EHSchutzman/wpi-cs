		<h3>Technology: Cloning</h3>
		<p>
		Scientists have been successful in developing clones of several animals, including the famous Dolly the sheep, but human cloning is just not feasible yet. In animal cloning, biological lab equipment technologies (such as robotic arms to inject cells, microscopes, computers, etc.) are used to remove the nucleus of a donor adult cell to an egg cell where the nucleus has been removed. However, humans are much more biologically complex than other animals that have been cloned in the past and certain problems (such as the accidental removal of proteins in an egg cell and complexities related to only having one parent) would arise and present many ethical problems (see: <a href="http://www.livescience.com/32083-cloning-people-biology.html">http://www.livescience.com/32083-cloning-people-biology.html</a>). These problems that would be encountered if scientists attempted the cloning process for humans would ultimately lead to high death rates and physical abnormalities; issues that a much more acceptable for testing on animals, not humans. In addition, cloned beings only take the physical appearance of the original being and nothing else. They do not share memories or thoughts identical to their original version and often have completely different personalities (see: <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cloning/cloningmyths/"> http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cloning/cloningmyths/</a>).
