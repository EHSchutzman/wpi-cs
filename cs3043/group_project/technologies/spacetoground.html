		<h3>Technology: Space to Ground Communications</h3>
		<p>
			Communications between the ground and space is quite developed today. One common example is the advertisements for satellite TV and internet that can be found on television networks. A more advanced example, showing people on the ground communicating with people in space is the NASA "Tracking and Data Relay" Satellite Fleet (see: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">http://www.nasa.gov/</a>). This network of satellites is used to keep in contact with people in orbit and has virtually 100% area coverage. This fleet has been operational for quite awhile, with the youngest being sent up in 2002, and the oldest during 1983 (see: <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/101196/how-do-astronauts-on-the-space-station-stay-in-touch-with-earth/">http://www.universetoday.com/101196/how-do-astronauts-on-the-space-station-stay-in-touch-with-earth/</a>). The continued use of the network shows that it is a stable and reliable communication method that may continue to be used for many years to come.
