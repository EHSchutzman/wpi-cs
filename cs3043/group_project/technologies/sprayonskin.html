		<h3>Technology: Spray On Skin</h3>
		<p>
			Spray on skin is currently in use in Australia and other areas around the globe but not approved for use in the United States. Before "spray on skin" was invented, the popular treatment to injuries requiring the replacement of skin involved culturing the victims own skin for 21 days, allowing time for noticeable scarring. After the culture became a "sheet" of skin it was grafted to the injury. The idea of spray on skin uses the same process but attaches the skin to the injury sooner. Before the cells have time to congeal into a solid sheet of skin they are sprayed over the affected area (usually 5 days after extraction from the victim) allowing the wound to culture these cells rather than a laboratory environment. The current state of development is in the area of mobility, creating kits that will allow surgeons to perform the process by themselves (see: <a href="http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/pharmaceuticals/spray_on_skin.html">http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/pharmaceuticals/spray_on_skin.html</a>).
