		<h3>Technology: Spaceships</h3>
		<p>
			While it is common knowledge that current spaceship technology can send people into space and build space stations, far more interesting is where this technology seems to be heading. Gigantic spaceships such as the popular "Enterprise" from the popular show Star Trek may be nearer to reality then anticipated. For anyone who has not seen the many Television series or sequels, the popular space vehicle generates its own gravity, contains a stable atmosphere, and travels between planets with ease. Some people believe that at current levels of technology building a ship like the Enterprise would take only 20 years. There even exists a dedicated website with designs, funding requirements, and calculations to demonstrate feasibility. This website does a good job to demonstrate that those popular fiction works have a good chance of becoming real (see: <a href="http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/">http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/</a>).
