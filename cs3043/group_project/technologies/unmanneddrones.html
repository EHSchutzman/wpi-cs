		<h3>Technology: Unmanned Drones</h3>
		<p>		
		In the real world, the past ten to twenty years have seen a large increase in the amount of drones the U.S. military are employing. The closest technology to the drones seen in Oblivion are Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (or UAVs). These vehicles can fly either autonomously or be remote controlled from a particular individual on the ground. Much like the drones in the movie, they are used to scan certain zones and uncover threats or other important objects that might be difficult to locate otherwise. (see: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/16/why-drone-makers-have-declared-war-on-the-word-drone/"> http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/16/why-drone-makers-have-declared-war-on-the-word-drone/</a>). More recently, however, UAV drones have been developed for attacking targets as well and operators potentially on the other side of the world choose targets to kill through the lens of a camera (see: <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201311/drone-uav-pilot-assassination"> http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201311/drone-uav-pilot-assassination</a>).
