		<h3>Character: Vika</h3>
		<p>
		Vika is also a clone and is Jack's working partner. She portrays the mindless adherence to institutionalized beliefs, despite being presented with evidence that all is not as it appears. Vika also represents acting without thought, seen through her emotional outburst reporting Jackâ€™s activities to the Tet space station which results in her death.
