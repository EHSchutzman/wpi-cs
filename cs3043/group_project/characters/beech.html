		<h3>Character: Beech</h3>
		<p>
		Beech is the leader of the resistance movement against the controlling AI. He represents the idealistic set of beliefs, and thinks about the greater good for humanity. He also balances this greater good with individual rights. This is seen when he helps Jack come to terms with the fact that he is actually a clone and guides him toward destroying the controlling AI rather than forcing him through unethical methods.
