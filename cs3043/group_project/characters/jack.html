		<h3>Character: Jack Harper</h3>
		<p>
		Jack Harper follows his own set of ethical beliefs even though he is programmed by the AI. He does not hesitate to think for himself, and through examining memories of his past life along with seeing supporting evidence he accepts that he has been lied to. He believes in evidence, and is willing to alter his beliefs based on evidence to the contrary, showing that he prefers being morally right to being consistent. He is also willing to risk his safety for others, as seen when he puts himself in a droneâ€™s killzone to save the targeted human.
