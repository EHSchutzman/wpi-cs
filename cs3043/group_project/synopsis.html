		<h3>Movie Synopsis</h3>
		<p>		
			The movie is a science fiction film set in 2077. The premise is that Earth had a war with extraterrestrial entities called Scavengers (colloquially called "Scavs"), and the landmass was ravaged by the use of nuclear weapons that won humanity the war but cost them the Earth. Humans are thus moving off-planet to the moon Titan. The "Tet" is a spaceship that is used as a staging point for those moving off-planet. On Earth, some human teams have been left behind to protect huge fusion energy generators from Scav attacks. These generators are being used to provide power to the inhabitants on Titan.
			<br /><br />
			Jack and Vika are one such team. Jack is the technician who fixes the patrolling drones, and Vika is his partner, lover, and communications officer. Jack is plagued by recurring dreams of a woman that he eventually finds. Her name is Julia, and she professes herself to be Jack's wife. Jack and Julia get captured by Scavs, and it is revealed that the Scavs are actually humans that are led by a man known as Beech.
			<br /><br />
			Beech reveals that the Tet is actually an hostile alien entity that is scavenging the Earth for resources. It is also revealed that Jack, Vika, and Julia were the members of the Odyssey spaceship that had been sent by NASA to investigate the original appearance of the Tet. The Tet captured the Odyssey and is using clones of Jack and Vika to protect the drones and fusion generators. Jack and Beech eventually team up to destroy the Tet using one of the drones.
			<br /><br />
			Jack and Beech confront the alien intelligence aboard the Tet, and blow it up using a fuel cell bomb. However, the explosion also kills both of them.
			<br /><br />
			A few years later, Julia encounters another clone of Jack who has realised the truth, and they unite once more.
