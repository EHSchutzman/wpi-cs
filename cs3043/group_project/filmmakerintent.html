		<h3>Filmmaker's Intent</h3>
		<p>		
		Through the use of clones, the question of how to define individuality is brought up. The opinion presented by the movie is that if one dies, another clone can step in and continue the deceased person's life. The use of drones as weapons brings up the morality of drone warfare and draws parallels to the questions facing us today about the uses of drones. The one way flow of information between the techs and the Tet space station may also be a satyr on the transparency of government.
