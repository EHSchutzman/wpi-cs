		<h3>Conclusions</h3>
		<p>
			We came to the following three conclusions at the end of our project:
			<br /><br />
			<b>1) Future technological developments could harm humanity if used for negative purposes</b>
			<br /><br />
			One of the main implications of technology the movie's filmmakers were trying to convey was the danger of complex technologies that are on the brink of coming into existence. Oblivion highlights the use of drone and cloning technologies and intentionally portrays the two in a negative light. When Jack learns that the truth about the Tet, he realizes that the drones were programmed to stop any kind of human resistance from interfering with the alien takeover of the planet. The drones do not hesitate to kill in a moment's notice and can easily separate friend from foe. Similarly, the advanced form of human cloning shown in Oblivion explains the dangers of using the technology to create a clone "army". The Tet cares little about the fate of the clones it has made and does not hesitate to enslave them for maintenance work or as disposable soldiers.
			<br /><br />
			<b>2) The growth of technology allows for easier surveillance of others</b>
			<br /><br />
			The filmmakers also exemplify the use of technology to conduct surveillance throughout the movie. The Tet uses "Sally" in combination with various technologies such as wireless communications to keep in contact with each individual station as well as the various technicians' transportation vehicles. It is even alluded to that the Tet uses further monitoring to secretly examine the actions of the clones at all times. The only way that Jack is able to escape the alien's watch is when he travels off the grid to his secret hideout to experience life as a normal human being.
			<br /><br />
			<b>3) Critical thinking about these technologies is important to society</b>
			<br /><br />
			The film leaves the viewer with a host of questions regarding topics of morality and personhood. What does it mean to be an individual? Further, when one is cloned, does the clone retain the same individuality as the "original" human? The past years have seen DNA heralded as the great identifier of uniqueness and individuality. However, clones share DNA. Thus, to deal with that reality, it appears that a new construct of personhood is required - one that revolves around experiences and memories. Indeed, the movie seems to point the viewer toward that inference, relying heavily on Jack's recollections of his past life as a differentiating factor between number 47 and number 52.
