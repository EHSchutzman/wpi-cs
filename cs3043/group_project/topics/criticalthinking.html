		<h3>Topic: Critical Thinking</h3>
		<p>		
		Since the start of the movie, it is shown that Jack trusts Vika based off the memories implanted by the Tet. However, he decides to trust Julia based off his instinct.
		<br /><br />
		The clones are not allowed to think about their lives. If they start to question, or to venture into the "radiation" zones, the story that the Tet fabricated so carefully would fall apart.
		<br /><br />
		Beech challenges Jack to think critically about the evidence presented to him both by his own flashbacks of Julia and by the experiences of the Scavs.
		<br /><br />
		Vika does not want to confront the reality that is presented to her by Jack because she is too ingrained in her way of life to think critically about the evidence and what it represents.
