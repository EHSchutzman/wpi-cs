		<h3>Topic: Privacy</h3>
		<p>
			The concept of invasion of privacy in regards to computing devices is a prominent point in the world of Oblivion. Jack and Vika face constant surveillance by “Sally” under the guise of a mission controller. Not knowing any better, the two view this as a necessity for their work. However, it is actually a method for the Tet to invade their rights of privacy and use them to accomplish its goal. The Tet does this by frequently checking in on the status of their working and personal relationship (“Are you an effective team?”) to search for any potential signs of rebellion. In addition, “Sally” is constantly providing Jack with objectives to complete, such as drone repair and the protection of the energy convertors, and observes him to make sure the task is completed without question. Jack even notices these invasions of privacy, but dismisses them as just an aspect of the job. Instead, he frequently escapes from the watchful eyes of “Sally” and Vika to travel to his hideaway and live the life he wants.
