		<h3>Topic: Crime</h3>
		<p>		
		The subject of crime and law enforcement is still present in the post apocalyptic world of Oblivion, although its moral and institutional implementations are very different. From the institutional point of view, the techs working on the planets surface have a very restrictive list of regulations that they must follow. As shown in the movie, breaking these regulations can result in death. The big picture morality of crime however points to the Tet space station being a criminal influence. It has invaded and nearly destroyed an indigenous population and now loots the area it has claimed for resources.
