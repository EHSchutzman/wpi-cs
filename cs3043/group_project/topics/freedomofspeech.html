		<h3>Topic: Freedom of Speech</h3>
		<p>		
		It can be argued that the clones do possess freedom of speech in a very limited manner. They are free to say what they want to one another, but the fact that their reality has been altered by the Tet mind-wiping them is an instance of the controlling entity altering their freedoms.
		<br /><br />
		Even then, the clones also practice full freedom of speech because saying that they are not an effective team to Sally would result in killer drones being set after them (as indeed is later played out in the film).
		<br /><br />
		The Scavs are being hunted already by the Tet, so the concept of freedom of speech (or lack thereof) doesn't apply in that they will be hunted mercilessly regardless of what they choose to say or not.
		<br /><br />
		Interestingly, the Tet, being the controlling entity, also does not have full freedom of speech in that it cannot talk to the clones about its manipulation of them or they would revolt.
